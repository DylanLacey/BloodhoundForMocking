# API Mocking With Bloodhound
Hello Friend! This repo contains an example used during @Dylan Lacey's 2021 talk at SauceCon, entitled "Horrible Adventures Through Code: Slack Edition".

In that talk, Dylan demonstrated some principles for refactoring Test code, as well as a quick example of using API Fortress to mock a live API for testing purposes.  This repo contains the config Dylan used for that mocking.
